# ![About](/images/about.png)About 
This project was conceived as a digital reference library for academic literature, complete with reference librarian, archivist, card catalog, stacks, and library. Working backwards, the stacks are a collected assortment of article PDFs contained within a single folder library. The card catalog is a collection of interrelated keyword:value metadata JSONs for the article, author, organization, and grant information contained within each PDF. The archivist is the AI/ML program responsible for entering new data into the system and periodically updating old data, and the reference librarian the algorithm responsible for looking up specific relevant information at the user's behest.

Do you have a need to organize your academic literature PDF collection to facilitate research? Do you desire an aide memoire to help you track down specific author, technique, organization, or grant metadata about that one paper you barely remember reading or conduct a laser specific literature review to help plan a forthcoming project? Do you currently curate a horribly large collection of PDF files and graduate students with idle time to manually drag-and-drop each and every one of them? Then this application might just be for you!

## Stage 1 - Plan
- [X] Define problem scope
- [X] Define target user
- [X] Write project documentation
## Stage 2 - Prototype
- [X] Design system mechanics
- [ ] Create sample metadata JSONs
- [ ] Create HTML data entry programs
- [ ] Create HTML data retrieval programs
- [ ] Code simple GUI
- [ ] Unit test and optimize code
- [ ] Soft launch prototype, alpha vesion, freeware
- [ ] Solicit alpha user feedback
## Stage 3 - Prune
- [ ] Create JS graph-encoded neural network template
- [ ] Create programs to train and test the network using PDF input and corresponding JSON data output
- [ ] Train a CNN to parse visual PDF data into relevant system variables
- [ ] Create a webscraper to reference those variables to redress PDF information gaps
- [ ] Create program to take CNN results and append the appropriate JSON files
## Stage 4 - Playtest
